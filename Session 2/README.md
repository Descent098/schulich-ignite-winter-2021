# Session 2; An Introduction to Classes and Objects

In this session we are going to give an introduction to [classes and objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) in python. Classes and objects are the basis of [OOP(Object Oriented Programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#:~:text=Object-oriented%20programming%20(OOP),(often%20known%20as%20methods)) and will be used extensively throughout the course, and in lots of existing python code.

You have already used Objects so far in the course (Integers (int), Strings (str), Lists(list)) without even knowing it. Now it's time to learn what they are, and how you can create your own!


**NOTE**: Out of habit I use different terms, so when i'm talking in class ```instance == object``` and ```member values == attributes```

## Agenda

## Further Reading

All of these links below will expand on what was taught about classes, and teach you some interesting things about them. You don't need to know any of these things for the course, but they're useful tools for python in general:
