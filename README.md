# Ignite Flare W2021

Welcome to my notes and files from mentoring for the schulich ignite flare winter 2021 session. 

## Session folder layout

Each session will have python files that correspond to each exercise. Files that end in `_skeleton.py` are starter files to get you started with the exercise. Files that end in `_solution.py`, are files that contain a solution. 

There will also be a file called `README.md` in every folder, this file will contain slide links, and additional info for the sessions. Any files with different names will have an explanation in the `README` file. I will also give you links to any interesting resources that pretain to the course content, or to topics you have expressed an interest in.

## Ways to contact me

The best way is on the class discord, reach out to me during session if you do not have access. That will be the most efficient way to have questions answered from me.

If you have questions about the program or any systems inside the program then reach out to the schulich ignite contact email [here](https://schulichignite.com/contact/) (Form at bottom of page)
